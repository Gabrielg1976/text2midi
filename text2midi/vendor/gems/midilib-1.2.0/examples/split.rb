#
# This script splits a MIDI file into muliple files, one for each track. The
# output files are named with the track's names. Each file contains a copy of
# the 0th track, which contains tempo information.
#
# If -x is specified, the 0th temp track is not included in each file.
# Instead, it is output in a separate file named 'tempo_track.mid'.

# Start looking for MIDI module classes in the directory above this one.
# This forces us to use the local copy, even if there is a previously
# installed version out there somewhere.
